# wip-license-hook

Detect license rug-pulls before they reach your codebase.

## Commands

### Initialize ledger for a project
```bash
wip-license-hook init --repo /path/to/repo
```
Scans all current dependencies and forks, records their licenses, creates `LICENSE-LEDGER.json`.

### Scan all dependencies
```bash
wip-license-hook scan --all
```
Checks every dependency and fork against the ledger. Updates `last_checked`. Flags any changes.

### Pre-merge gate
```bash
wip-license-hook gate --upstream <remote>
```
Fetches upstream without merging. Checks license. Returns exit code 0 (safe) or 1 (changed/blocked).

Use in git hooks or CI.

### Generate report
```bash
wip-license-hook report
```
Outputs a human-readable license health report.

### Generate dashboard
```bash
wip-license-hook dashboard --output ./docs
```
Creates a static HTML dashboard from the ledger. Deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Daily Cron Usage

Add to HEARTBEAT.md or as a cron job:
```
wip-license-hook scan --all --alert
```

If any license changed, sends alert via configured channel (email, iMessage, Discord).

## What It Detects

- LICENSE file content changes
- package.json license field changes
- SPDX header changes
- License removal (file deleted)
- License downgrade (permissive → restrictive)

## What It Does NOT Do

- It does not legal advice make
- It does not auto-merge anything ever
- It does not modify upstream code

## Alert Levels

- 🟢 **Clean** — license unchanged since adoption
- 🟡 **Warning** — license metadata inconsistency (e.g., LICENSE file says MIT but package.json says ISC)
- 🔴 **Blocked** — license changed from what was adopted. Merge blocked. Human review required.
